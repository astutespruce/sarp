This inventory is a growing and living database of dams and road / stream crossings compiled by
the Southeast Aquatic Resources Partnership with the generous support from many partners and
funders. Information about network connectivity, landscape condition, and presence of threatened
and endangered aquatic organisms are added to this inventory to help you investigate barriers at
any scale for your desired purposes.

This inventory consists of datasets from local, state, and federal partners. It is supplemented
with input from partners with on the ground knowledge of specific structures. The information on
barriers is not complete or comprehensive across the region, and depends on the availability and
completeness of existing data and level of partner feedback. Some areas of the region are more complete than others but none
should be considered 100% complete.

All network analyses were conducted using the NHD High Resolution Plus dataset
(https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/ngp/national-hydrography/nhdplus-high-resolution).

If you are able to help improve the inventory by sharing data or assisting with field
reconnaissance, please contact us (https://southeastaquatics.net/about/contact-us).

Note: data come from a variety of sources and available descriptive information is not comprehensive.

Also Note: information on rare species is highly limited.
