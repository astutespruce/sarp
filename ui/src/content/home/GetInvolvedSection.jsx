            is also one of the first Fish Habitat Partnerships under the the
            National Fish Habitat Partnership umbrella that works to conserve
            and protect the nationâ€™s fisheries and aquatic systems through a

            SARP and partners have been working to build a community of practice
            surrounding barrier removal through the development of state-based
            Aquatic Connectivity Teams (ACTs). These teams create a forum that
            allows resource managers from all sectors to work together and share
            resources, disseminate information, and examine regulatory
            streamlining processes as well as project management tips and
            techniques. These teams are active in Arkansas, Florida, Georgia,
            North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia.
