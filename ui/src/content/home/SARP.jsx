              SARP works with partners to protect, conserve, and restore aquatic
              resources including habitats throughout the Southeast for the
              continuing benefit, use, and enjoyment of the American people.
              SARP is also one of the first Fish Habitat Partnerships under the
              the National Fish Habitat Partnership umbrella that works to
              conserve and protect the nationâ€™s fisheries and aquatic systems
              through a network of 20 Fish Habitat Partnerships.

              SARP and partners have been working to build a community of
              practice surrounding barrier removal through the development of
              state-based Aquatic Connectivity Teams (ACTs). These teams create
              a forum that allows resource managers from all sectors to work
              together and share resources, disseminate information, and examine
              regulatory streamlining processes as well as project management
              tips and techniques. These teams are active in Arkansas, Florida,
              Georgia, North Carolina, and Tennessee.
