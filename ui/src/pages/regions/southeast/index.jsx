              &nbsp; (SARP) was formed by the Southeastern Association of Fish
              and Wildlife Agencies (SEAFWA) to protect aquatic resources across
              political boundaries as many of our river systems cross multiple
              jurisdictional boundaries. SARP works with partners to protect,
              conserve, and restore aquatic resources including habitats
              throughout the Southeast for the continuing benefit, use, and
              enjoyment of the American people. SARP is also one of the first
              Fish Habitat Partnerships under the the National Fish Habitat
              Partnership umbrella that works to conserve and protect the
              nationâ€™s fisheries and aquatic systems through a network of 20
              Fish Habitat Partnerships.
              <br />
              <br />
              SARP and partners within the region have been working for several
              years to compile a comprehensive inventory of aquatic barriers
              across the region. This inventory is the foundation of{' '}

              SARP and partners have been working to build a community of
              practice surrounding barrier removal through the development of
              state-based Aquatic Connectivity Teams (ACTs). These teams create
              a forum that allows resource managers from all sectors to work
              together and share resources, disseminate information, and examine
              regulatory streamlining processes as well as project management
              tips and techniques. These teams are active in Arkansas, Florida,
              Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia.
