                        &nbsp; (SARP) was formed by the Southeastern Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies (SEAFWA)
                        to protect aquatic resources across political boundaries as many of our river systems cross
                        multiple jurisdictional boundaries.

                SARP works with partners to protect, conserve, and restore aquatic resources including habitats
                throughout the Southeast for the continuing benefit, use, and enjoyment of the American people. SARP is
                also one of the first Fish Habitat Partnerships under the the National Fish Habitat Partnership umbrella
                that works to conserve and protect the nationâ€™s fisheries and aquatic systems through a network of 20
                Fish Habitat Partnerships.

                SARP and partners have been working to build a community of practice surrounding barrier removal through
                the development of state-based Aquatic Connectivity Teams (ACTs). These teams create a forum that allows
                resource managers from all sectors to work together and share resources, disseminate information, and
                examine regulatory streamlining processes as well as project management tips and techniques. These teams
                are active in Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, and Tennessee.
