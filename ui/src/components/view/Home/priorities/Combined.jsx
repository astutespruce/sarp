                Aquatic barriers prioritized according to combined network connectivity and watershed condition are
                driven by both the length and quality of the aquatic networks that would be reconnected if these
                barriers are removed. Network connectivity and watershed condition are weighted equally.
                <br />
                <br />
                This prioritization will be most useful for you if your aquatic restoration goals focused on both the
                length and quality of the aquatic networks you are able to reconnect by removing aquatic barriers. This
                prioritization will highlight barriers that open a large number of miles of higher quality. This is
                useful for user that would like to improve the overall habitat quality of the area and for species that
                require both a larger network but of high quality. This is the most popular scenario.
