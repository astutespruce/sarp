                Aquatic barriers prioritized according to combined network connectivity and watershed condition are
                driven by both the length and quality of the aquatic networks that would be reconnected if these
                barriers are removed. Network connectivity and watershed condition are weighted equally.
                <br />
                <br />
                This prioritization will be most useful for you if your aquatic restoration goals focused on both the
                length and quality of the aquatic networks you are able to reconnect by removing aquatic barriers.
