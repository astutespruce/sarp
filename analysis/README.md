# Southeast Aquatic Barrier Inventory Data Processing

## Overview

Basic processing not dependent on the inventory includes:

1. Extraction and processing of summary units and other boundaries
2. Creation of summary unit vector tiles

Processing on updates to the inventory is derived into 3 main parts:

1. Network analysis of barriers (dams, small barriers, and waterfalls)
2. Prioritization analysis of barriers
3. Creation of vector tiles for the barriers datasets
